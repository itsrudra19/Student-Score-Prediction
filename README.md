# Student-Score-Prediction
In this project, a simple model has been proposed to predict the performance of students in an academic organization. The algorithm employed is a machine learning technique called Linear Regression.
The idea behind this analysis is to predict the marks of students by their studying hours.
In recent times, the education sector in this country has witnessed major innovations, that have made learning more student-friendly. I believe that by implementing these kinds of solutions at an advanced level, we can assess students in a better way and it can help solve issues that come with learning when it comes to personalized education.
To implement this model I have used Jupyter Notebook which is an open web source application.
